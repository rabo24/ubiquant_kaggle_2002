Build a model that forecasts an investment's return rate

  I am going to train models that forecasts an investment's return rate and submit my best model in this Kaggle competition. 
There are 300 variables/features and I am going to do feature analysis to determine best features including some data visualization. 
The variables are hard to do analysis on because the competition does not tell us what the features are, only that they are time dependent.
